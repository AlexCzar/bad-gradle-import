= bad-gradle-import

Demo project for to demonstrate gradle adding unnecessary libs to classpath

== How to reproduce

.Kotlin-dsl
. clone the project
. run `./gradlew build`

it won't work with following exception (trace removed for brevity):
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to load ApplicationContext
...
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: LoggerFactory is not a Logback LoggerContext but Logback is on the classpath. Either remove Logback or the competing implementation (class org.gradle.internal.logging.slf4j.OutputEventListenerBackedLoggerContext loaded from file:/home/czar/.gradle/caches/4.3/generated-gradle-jars/gradle-api-4.3.jar). If you are using WebLogic you will need to add 'org.slf4j' to prefer-application-packages in WEB-INF/weblogic.xml: org.gradle.internal.logging.slf4j.OutputEventListenerBackedLoggerContext
...
```

.Groovy
. comment out buildFileName in gradle.settings to switch to groovy based configuration
. run `./gradlew build`

it will work in spite of both files being the same in terms of what is configured
